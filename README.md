## What was I supposed to be doing?
For this assignment I was supposed to be scraping a website and allowing users to comment on the articles I scraped on my own webpage

## Technologies used:
* HTML
* Node/express
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Mongo

## What I did
The first thing I did was created my mechanism for scraping the website I wanted to scrape(in this case it was the Onion), then I configured all my routes to render my data and html document once written. Then I made my models for both articles and comments on said articles. After that I wrote my HTML document and wrote my client-side JavaScript to interact with my routes and render the content I was scraping. Then I added some basic styling.

## Issues
I had a hard time getting the exact syntax for scraping down because The Onion has a lot of layers of divs which made tracking down the information I needed more difficult than it otherwise would have been. Also I was a bit more pressed for time on this project so I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to style it. Also I couldn't get Heroku to work with it.
